            <h2 class="secHeading">"Best Hill Stations"</h2>
            <p class="text">
                Most of the hill stations in India were developed by the British, around a central mall, to get respite from the oppressive summer heat. 
                Many have picturesque lakes as their focal point, making them excellent places for boating activities. 
                One thing is for sure, you won't be short of things to do at any of the hill stations in India. 
                You'll find them all over the country. And, to add to the adventure, it's possible to take a toy train ride up to some of them. 
                This article lists the most popular ones. Unfortunately, many of the hill stations have become overcrowded, especially during summer. 
                Hence, some quieter nearby alternatives have also been mentioned.

            <p class="text">
                Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir, delights visitors with its lovely lakes and relaxing houseboats. 
                In fact, lakes and gardens are in such abundance there that Srinagar is often referred to as the "Land of Lakes and Gardens". 
                The gardens have a distinctly Mughal influence, as many of them were cultivated by Mughal emperors. You'll find Asia's largest tulip garden in Srinagar, with a tulip festival held every April. 
                Srinagar is a great place to visit if you're a golf enthusiast, as there are a number of courses there. 
                Don't miss the many must-see Srinagar attractions.
